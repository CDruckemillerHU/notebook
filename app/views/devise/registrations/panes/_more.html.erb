            I, <%= current_user.email %>, want to delete my account in full. I understand that my entire account,
            as well as any and all content created by me, including any content I've contributed to other
            universes but still own, will be immediately and permanently deleted and will not be recoverable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I understand all of my posts on <%= link_to 'the forums', thredded_path %> will also be deleted.
